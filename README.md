# Simple implementation of the Conway's Game of Life in python3

In this implementation the universe is finite; user sets its size before the game starts. For visualization [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is used. Several unit tests are implemented to test the rules of the game on simple initial population. To run tests use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/). To run the game type in terminal: python3 main.py
